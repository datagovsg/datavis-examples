After the World War II, antibiotics were considered as "wonder drugs", 
since they were easy remedy for what had been intractable ailments. 
To learn which drug worked most effectively for which bacterial infection, 
performance of the three most popular antibiotics on 16 bacteria were gathered.
  
# Explanation on data set
The data is a table with the following columns:  
- `Bacteria`: name of the bacteria where the first word denote the family the bacteria belongs to.   
- `Penicilin`: minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for penicilin to stop bacteria growth.  
- `Streptomycin`: minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for streptomycin to stop bacteria growth.  
- `Neomycin`: minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for neomycin to stop bacteria growth.  
- `Gram Staining`: whether the bacteria is gram-positive or gram-negative.  
  
The values in the table represent the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), 
a measure of the effectiveness of the antibiotic, which represents the 
concentration of antibiotic required to prevent growth in vitro. 
  
The reaction of the bacteria to Gram staining is described by the covariate “gram staining”. 
Bacteria that are stained dark blue or violet are Gram-positive. Otherwise, they 
are Gram-negative.
